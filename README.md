# NBA-PPP-Analysis
Uses the data set from here: https://data.world/sportsvizsunday/june-2020-nba-shots-1997-2019 to analyse points per possession, e.g., I calculated the points per possession from every spot where a shot was taken and then plotted and colour coded these on a basketball half-court using Tableau

This only contains the python files that manipulate the data. The CSV's and Tableau files are not included
